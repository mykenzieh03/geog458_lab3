#### Project Name: Covid Web Map Applications
#### Introduction:
In this lab we were task with creating two interactive maps using javascript, css, and html. We were able to creat 2 maps one being proportional and the other choropleth to represent covid counts and rates. Both of these maps have interactive features such as for the proportional map users are able to hover over the circles to get the county and amount of cases. For the choropleth map users are able to hover over any county to get the related covid cases for that county. This project also covers the nation, so users are able to see how covid impacted and compare counties across the nation. 

#### Links to the Map

#### Libraries in Use 
Some libraries that are being used in map 1 are mapbox GL JS, Fetch API, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Mapbox GL JS key library uses resources mentioned in the code such as CSS sytlesheet, JavaScript library, and the Access token. For Fetch API, mentions the 'fetch' function that is used to make an asynchronoous requrest to fetch geojob data from the json layer. Lastly, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript uses resources such as standard HTML tags for structure, inline styles for CSS to define the appearance and layout and JavaScript for handling the map interactions, fetching data, and updating the content. Map 2 does use the same libraries as map 1, the only difference is th euse of google fonts.

#### Data sources
The data sources used to create these maps are the COVID-19 case/death data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv) and the population data used for calculating the case rates from the [2018 ACS 5 year estimates](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP5Y2018.DP05?g=0100000US$050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&hidePreview=true)
